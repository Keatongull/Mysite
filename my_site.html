        <h2>The Feel of Winter</h2>
        <p>My Haiku on one of my favorite things, skiing.</p>
        <p><em>Alpine air so crisp,<br>Downhill thrill, a snowy waltz,<br>Skiing slopes, pure bliss.</em></p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy music a lot. When people ask me what kind of music I like usually it's easier to tell them what kind of music I dont like.<br> I will listen to nearly everything if the occasion is right. Along with listening to music I enjoy going to concerts and playing the guitar.</p>
        <p>In the summers I love going to national parks near by. Hiking climbing rafting in rivers are all amazing and they allow me to escape the stresses of life.<br> I also enjoy playing pickleball. I play in a lot of local tournaments and its always fun to play. I usually enjoy playing doubles but if the right opponent comes along<br> I have been known to play some singles.</p>
        <p>In the winter it is all about skiing for me. I am currently an Ikon pass holder and I love it. It allows me to go whenever I want and nearly wherever I want.<br> I got back into skiing last year after taking a few years off, and I couldn't be happier to be back to skiing. I am hoping that we have a long winter,<br> and I am able to ski as much as I did last year.</p>
